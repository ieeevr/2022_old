        The IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (IEEE VR) is the premier international event for the presentation of research results in the broad area of virtual reality (VR). IEEE VR brings together leaders, innovators, and influencers to disseminate the latest virtual reality research and advancements being developed from around the world.

    <p>
        Since 1993, IEEE VR has presented groundbreaking research and accomplishments by virtual reality pioneers: scientists, engineers, designers, and artists, paving the way for the future. A globally recognized event for introducing the next big advancements in VR, IEEE VR 2021 will feature oral presentations, posters, research demos, and workshops.

        We are committed to providing the best virtual experience possible. IEEE VR will be an all-online format, and we will use video streams and web-based 3D spaces to host all conference activities. While some contributions like paper presentations are well suited to streaming (using tools like <a href="https://zoom.us" target="_blank">Zoom</a>/<a href="https://discord.com">Discord</a>), others like demos and posters can benefit from the usage of a 3D space like the <a href="https://immersivelrn.org/ilrn-virtual-campus/" target="_blank">immersive Learning Research Network (iLRN)</a>, powered by <a href="https://www.virbela.com/" target="_blank">VirBELA</a>, to enhance collaboration and presence. In all tracks, attendees will be able to interact with leaders on the field, as scientists, practitioners, organizations, and innovators through VR 2021 platforms.
